    "Candidates" are individuals who have been added to your Lever account as potential fits for your open job positions. "Opportunities" represent each of an individual’s unique candidacies or journeys through your pipeline for a given job position, meaning a single Candidate can be associated to multiple Opportunities. A “Contact” is a unique individual who may or may not have multiple candidacies or Opportunities.

    Candidates enter your pipeline for a new Opportunity by:

    Applying to a posting on your jobs site,
    Being added by an external recruiting agency,
    Being referred by an employee,
    Being manually added by a Lever user, or
    Being sourced from an online profile.
    Each Opportunity can have their own notes, feedback, interview schedules, and additional forms. An opportunity may be “confidential” if it is moving through your pipeline for a job posting that has been created as confidential. Opportunities exit your pipeline by being archived for one of two reasons: (1) The candidate was rejected for the opportunity, or (2) The candidate was hired for the opportunity.

    A "Contact" is an object that our application uses internally to identify an individual person and their personal or contact information, even though they may have multiple opportunities. From this API, the "Contact" is exposed via the contact field, which returns the unique ID for a Contact across your account. Contact information will be shared and consistent across an individual person's opportunities, and will continue to be aggregated onto individual opportunities in the responses to all GET and POST requests to /opportunities.

    Lever is candidate-centric, meaning that candidates can exist in the system without being applied to a specific job posting. However, almost all candidates are applied to job postings, and thus almost all candidates have one or more applications.

    There are three different ways that applications can be created in Lever:

    Through a posting: An application is created when a candidate applies to a job posting through your company's public or internal job site, or is submitted by an agency.
    By a user: A team member at your company manually adds a job posting to a specific candidate in Lever.
    As a referral: A team member at your company refers the candidate into Lever for a specific job posting.
    Candidates can be applied to multiple job postings, meaning that candidates can have multiple applications. A candidate or contact may have multiple applications, each of which will be on a unique Opportunity. An Opportunity will have no more than one Application.    """
